<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The Official Belgian Commission of Inquiry, which has been charged with
the task of examining into the violation of the rules of International Law
and of the Customs of War, is composed of Statesmen and Jurists of the
highest standing. The Reports of the Commission have been published from
time to time. Report XI will be found in the following pages.</p>

<p>These reports are given out by the Commission only after careful examination
of the evidence. Consequently the findings of the Commission command
the same respect as the findings of the highest Law Court.</p>

<p>Names of witnesses have, in certain cases, been withheld from publication.
All the depositions are, however, in the possession of the Commission and
the names of the witnesses will be given out at the proper time. The publication
of these names at the present moment would, inevitably, cause the German
troops to take revenge upon witnesses, or upon the relatives of witnesses,
remaining within the German lines.</p>

<p>The authenticity of the depositions is guaranteed by the eminent Statesmen
and Jurists who compose the Commission and who have signed the
Reports.</p>

<p>No commentary can add anything to the tragic eloquence of these simple
and well-authenticated depositions. Who can read the recital of these horrors
without feeling his heart throb with righteous indignation, and without feeling
an infinite sorrow at the thought that these abominations have been committed,
after two thousand years of Christian civilization, by a nation which, only
yesterday, claimed to be the foremost in modern Progress.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that Belgium had done nothing to bring on the
war nor to involve her in it. She was a neutralized country. Every shot fired
by a German soldier in Belgium is a violation of the solemn treaty whereby
Germany pledged her faith to uphold the neutrality of Belgium.</p>

<p>At the end of this pamphlet (page <a href="#Page_20">20</a>) will be
found extracts from the &#8220;Laws of War on Land,&#8221; published by
the German General Staff in 1902, and other documents, showing that the
massacres, arson and pillage committed by the German army in Belgium
are attributable, not to the innate brutality of the German soldier,
but rather to an organized system of terrorism laid down and ordered by
the superior German Military authorities.</p>

<p>The authenticity of the following text of the Report of the Commission of
Inquiry is certified by the Belgian Legation, Washington, D. C.</p>

the Rules of International Law, and of the Laws and Customs of
War.</strong></p>

<p class="f80 center noindent"><strong>ELEVENTH REPORT SUBMITTED
TO HIS EXCELLENCY, MR. CARTON DE WIART, Belgian Minister of
Justice.</strong></p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3>(I.) INCIDENTS AT NAMUR.</h3>

<p>On August 21st, 1914, the Germans bombarded the town of Namur,
without any previous notice given. The bombardment began about 1 p.
m. and continued for twenty minutes. The besieger was in possession
of long-range guns, which enabled him to fire upon the town before
the forts had been taken. Shells fell upon the prison, the hospital,
the Burgomaster&#8217;s house and the railway station, causing
conflagrations and killing several persons.</p>

<p>On August 23rd, the German Army pierced the exterior line of
defence, and the Belgian 4th Division retreated by the angle between
the rivers Sambre and Meuse, while the greater number of the forts were
still uninjured and continuing to resist. The German troops penetrated
into the town of Namur on the same day about 4 p. m.</p>

<p>On this day order was preserved: officers and soldiers requisitioned
food and drink, paying for them sometimes with coined money, more often
with requisition-certificates. Most of the latter were bogus documents,
but the townspeople were trustful and ignorant of the German language,
and so accepted them without making difficulties.</p>

<p>Matters went on in the same way on August 24th till 9 o&#8217;clock
in the evening. At that hour shooting suddenly began in several
quarters of the town, and German infantry were seen advancing in
skirmishing order down the principal streets. Almost at the same
moment an immense column of smoke and fire was seen rising from the
central quarter of the place: the Germans had fired houses in the Place
d&#8217;Armes and four other spots, the Place Leopold, Rue Rogier, Rue
St. Nicolas and the Avenue de la Plante.</p>

<p>All was now panic among the peaceable and defenseless townsfolk: the
Germans began breaking open front doors with the butts of their rifles,
and throwing incendiary matter into the vestibules. Six dwellers in the
Rue Rogier, who were flying from their burning houses, were shot on
their own doorsteps. The rest of the inhabitants of this street were
forced to avoid a similar fate by escaping through their back gardens.
Many of them were in their night clothes, for they had not the time to
dress or to pick up their money.</p>

<p>In the Rue St. Nicolas several workmen&#8217;s dwellings were set on
fire, and a larger number, together with some wood-yards, were burned
in the Avenue de la Plante.</p>

<p>The conflagration in the Place d&#8217;Armes continued till
Thursday. It destroyed the Town Hall, with its archives and pictures,
the adjacent group of houses, and the whole quarter bounded by the
Rue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
du Pont, the Rue des Brasseurs, and the Rue Bailly, with the exception
of the Hotel des Quatre Fils Aymon.</p>

<p>No serious attempt was made to prevent the fire from spreading. At
its commencement some of the townspeople came out at the appeal of the
Fire-Bell, but they were forbidden to stir from their houses. The Chief
of the Fire Brigade, though the balls were whistling round him, got as
far as the site of the disaster; but an officer arrested him in the
Place d&#8217;Armes, and then, acting under the orders of his superior,
sent him away under an escort.</p>

<p>The Germans, with the object of justifying their proceedings,
alleged that shots had been fired against their troops on the Monday
evening. Every circumstance demonstrates the absurdity of this
statement. The juxtaposition of observed facts and the sequence of
concordant evidence lead to the conclusion that the incidents at Namur
were deliberately prepared, and merely formed part of the general
system of terrorism which was habitually practised by the German Army
in Belgium.</p>

<p>Fifteen days back the people of Namur had given over to the Belgian
Authorities all the firearms that they possessed. They had been
informed by Official Notices as to the tenor of the Laws of War, and
had been invited by the Civil and Military Authorities, by the Clergy
and the Press, to take no part with the belligerents. The Belgian
troops had evacuated the town 36 hours before the conflagration. The
people, even if they had possessed weapons, would not have been so
insane as to rise and assail the masses of German troops who crowded
the town and occupied all its approaches. And how can anyone account
for the strange fact that, at all the five points at which the alleged
rising was supposed to have broken out, the Germans were found in
possession of the incendiary substances which were required for the
prompt burning of the place?</p>

<p>The disorder which followed helped the pillage in which the German
Army habitually engages. In the Place d&#8217;Armes houses were
thoroughly sacked before they were set on fire. In the quarter by the
Gate of St. Nicolas the inhabitants, when they returned to their homes,
found that everything had been plundered; in one case a safe had been
broken up and 17,000 francs worth of securities had disappeared.</p>

<p>On the subsequent days, though things were comparatively quiet,
pillage continued. In several houses where German officers were
quartered, the furniture was broken up, and wine and underclothing
(even female underclothing) was stolen.</p>

<p>Our witnesses have detailed to us several outrages on women. In
one case we have evidence concerning the rape of a girl by four
soldiers. A Belgian quartermaster of Gendarmes saw the daughter of the
proprietor of the hotel in which he was staying outraged by two German
soldiers, without being able to intervene for her protection, at four
o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Many inhabitants of Namur perished during the fire and the
fusillade. Some aged people were left in the burning houses: others
were killed in the streets, or shot in their own dwellings. In all,
seventy-five civilians perished in one of these ways or another on the
23rd-24th-25th August.</p>

<p>We may mention, without detailing, the arrest of hostages, and the
brutal treatment to which the most distinguished inhabitants of the
town were exposed during the early days of German occupation.</p>

<p>Namur and the seventeen neighbouring communes were subjected to
a war contribution of fifty million francs (£2,000,000), which was
afterwards reduced to thirty-two millions, on condition that the first
million should be paid within twenty-four hours. The deposits at a
private bank (the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Banque Generale</i> Belge)
were confiscated. On the petition of its directors the concession was
made that the sum seized should count towards the war contribution.</p>

<p>The immediate neighborhood of the town was the scene of many similar
acts of violence. In this part of the province many mansions and
villas were systematically pillaged. One citizen of Namur saw his own
furniture from his country house going to the rear on a German cart.
The plunder was all sent off to Germany.</p>

<p>At Vedrin a boy was shot because he was found to have in his
possession an empty German cartridge case. Twenty-six priests and
members of religious orders were shot in the diocese of Namur.</p>

<hr class="r20" />

<h3>(II.) MASSACRE AT TAMINES.</h3>

<p>Tamines was a rich and populous village situated on the Sambre
between Charleroi and Namur. It was occupied by detachments of French
troops on the 17th, 18th and 19th of August last. On Thursday, the 20th
August, a German patrol appeared in front of the suburb of Vilaines. It
was greeted by shots fired by French soldiers, and by a party of the
Civic Guards of Charleroi. Several Uhlans were killed and wounded, and
the rest fled. The people of the village came out of their houses and
cried: &#8220;Vive la Belgique!&#8221; &#8220;Vive la France!&#8221;
In all probability it was this incident which caused the subsequent
massacre of Tamines.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards the Germans arrived in force at the hamlet
of Alloux. They there burnt two houses and made all the inhabitants
prisoners. An artillery combat broke out between the German guns posted
at Vilaines and at Alloux and the French guns placed in a battery at
Arsimont and at Hame-sur-Heure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>About 5 o&#8217;clock on 21st August, the Germans carried the bridge
of Tamines, crossed the River Sambre, and began defiling in mass
through the streets of the village. About 8 o&#8217;clock the movement
of troops stopped, and the soldiers penetrated into the houses, drove
out the inhabitants, set themselves to sack the place, and then burnt
it. The unfortunate peasants who stopped in the village were shot; the
rest fled from their houses. The greater part of them were arrested
either on the night of the 21st of August or on the following morning.
Pillage and burning continued all next day (22nd).</p>

<p>On the evening of the 22nd (Saturday) a group of between 400 and 450
men was collected in front of the Church, not far from the bank of the
Sambre. A German detachment opened fire on them, but as the shooting
was a slow business the officers ordered up a machine gun, which soon
swept off all the unhappy peasants still left standing. Many of them
were only wounded and, hoping to save their lives, got with difficulty
on their feet again. They were immediately shot down. Many wounded
still lay among the corpses. Groans of pain and cries for help were
heard in the bleeding heap. On several occasions soldiers walked up
to such unhappy individuals and stopped their groans with a bayonet
thrust. At night some who still survived succeeded in crawling away.
Others put an end to their own pain by rolling themselves into the
neighboring river.</p>

<p>All these facts have been established by depositions made by wounded
men who succeeded in escaping. About 100 bodies were found in the
river.</p>

<p>Next day, Sunday, the 23rd, about 6 o&#8217;clock in the morning,
another party consisting of prisoners made in the village and the
neighborhood were brought into the Square. One of them makes the
following deposition:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;On reaching the Square the first thing that we saw was a mass
of bodies of civilians extending over at least 40 yards in length by 6
yards in depth. They had evidently been drawn up in rank to be shot. We
were placed before this range of corpses, and were convinced that we
too were to be shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;An officer then came forward and asked for volunteers to dig
trenches to bury these corpses. I and my brother-in-law and certain
others offered ourselves. We were conducted to a neighbouring field at
the side of the Square, where they made us dig a trench 15 yards long
by 10 broad and 2 deep. Each received a spade. While we were digging
the trenches soldiers with fixed bayonets gave us our orders. As I
was much fatigued through not being accustomed to digging, and being
faint from hunger, a soldier then brought me a lighter spade, and
afterwards filled a bucket of water for us to drink. I asked him if he
knew what they were going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9"
id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> do with us. He said that he did not. By the
time that the trenches were finished it was about noon. They then gave
us some planks, on which we placed the corpses and so carried them
to the trench. I recognized many of the persons whose bodies we were
burying. Actually fathers buried the bodies of their sons and sons the
bodies of their fathers. The women of the village had been marched out
into the Square, and saw us at our work. All around were the burnt
houses.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were in the Square both soldiers and officers. They
were drinking champagne. The more the afternoon drew on the more they
drank, and the more we were disposed to think that we were probably
to be shot too. We buried from 350 to 400 bodies. A list of the names
of the victims has been drawn up and will have been given to you (the
Commissioner).</p>

<p>&#8220;While some of us were carrying the corpses along I saw a case
where they had stopped and called to a German doctor. They had noticed
that the man whom they were conveying was still alive. The doctor
examined the wounded man and made a sign that he was to be buried with
the rest. The plank on which he was lying was borne on again, and I saw
the wounded man raise his arm elbow-high. They called to the doctor
again, but he made a gesture that he was to go into the trench with the
others.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw M. X&mdash;&mdash; carrying off the body of his own
son-in-law. He was able to take away his watch, but was not allowed to
remove some papers which were on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a soldier, seized with an impulse of pity, came near
us, an officer immediately scolded him away. When all the bodies had
been interred, certain wounded were brought to the Church. Officers
consulted about them for some time. Four mounted officers came into
the Square, and, after a long conversation, we with our wives and
children were made to fall into marching order. We were taken through
Tamines, amid the debris which obstructed the streets, and led to
Vilaines between two ranks of soldiers. Think of our mental sufferings
during this march! We all thought that we were going to be shot in the
presence of our wives and children. I saw German soldiers who could not
refrain from bursting into tears, on seeing the despair of the women.
One of our party was seized with an apoplectic fit from mere terror,
and I saw many who fainted.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the cortege arrived at Vilaines, an officer told the unhappy
people that they were free, but that anyone returning to Tamines
would be shot. He obliged the women and children to cry: &#8220;Vive
l&#8217;Allemagne.&#8221; The Germans burnt, after sacking them,
264 houses in Tamines. Many persons, including women and children,
were burnt or stifled in their own homes. Many others were shot in
the fields. The total number of victims was over 650. The<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Commission of Enquiry devoted special attention to ascertaining whether
the inhabitants of the village had fired on the German troops. Every
surviving witness unanimously declared the contrary. They explained
the massacre of their fellow-villagers by the fact that the Germans
attributed to the inhabitants the shots which had been fired by the
French skirmishers, or perhaps to the anger produced among the Germans
by the success of an attack which had been made on them that night by
the French troops.</p>

<hr class="r20" />

<h3>(III.) PILLAGE AND MASSACRE AT ANDENNE.</h3>

<p>The town of Andenne is situated on the right bank of the Meuse
between Namur and Huy. It is connected by a bridge with the village
of Seilles, which is built along the river on the opposite, or left,
bank. The German troops who were wishing to invade the territory on
the left bank of the Meuse arrived at Andenne on Thursday, August
19th, in the morning. Their advance guard of Uhlans found that the
bridge was not available. A regiment of Belgian Infantry had blown it
up at 8 o&#8217;clock on the same morning. The Uhlans retired after
having seized the Communal cash box at Andenne and brutally maltreated
the Burgomaster, Dr. Camus, an old man of more than 70 years. The
Burgomaster had several days before taken the most minute precautions
to prevent the population from engaging in hostilities. He had posted
up everywhere placards ordering non-resistance. All firearms had
been collected in the Hotel de Ville, and the local authorities had
personally visited certain of the inhabitants to explain their duty to
them.</p>

<p>The main body of the German Troops arrived at Andenne in the
afternoon. The Regiment halted in the Town and outside it, waiting
for the completion of a pontoon bridge, which was not finished till
the following morning. The first contact between the troops and the
people was quite pacific. The Germans ordered requisitions, which were
satisfied. The soldiers at first paid for their purchases and for the
drink which they served to them in the Cafes. Towards the evening the
situation began to grow more strained. Whether it was that discipline
was getting relaxed, or that alcohol commenced to produce its effect,
the soldiers ceased paying for what they were taking. The inhabitants
were too scared to resist. No friction took place and the night was
calm.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 20th August, the bridge was finished and the troops
defiled through the town in great numbers in the direction of the left
bank. The inhabitants watched them passing from their houses. Suddenly,
at 6 o&#8217;clock in the evening, a single rifle shot was heard in
the street, followed immediately by a startling explosion.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> The
troops halted, their ranks fell into disorder, and nervous men fired
haphazard. Presently a machine gun was set up at a corner and commenced
to fire against the houses, and later a cannon dropped three shells
into the town at three different points.</p>

<p>At the first rifle shot the inhabitants of the streets through which
the troops were defiling, guessing what might happen, took refuge in
their cellars or, climbing out over the walls of their gardens, sought
refuge in the open country or in distant cellars. A certain number
of people who would not or could not make their escape were killed
in their houses by shots fired from the street, or in some cases by
soldiers who burst into their dwellings.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards commenced the pillage of the houses in the
principal streets of the Town. Every window shutter and door was broken
in. Furniture was smashed and thrown out. The soldiers ran down into
the cellars, got drunk there, breaking the bottles of wine that they
could not carry away. Finally, a certain number of houses were set on
fire. During the night rifle shooting broke out several times. The
terrified population lay low in their cellars.</p>

<p>Next day, Friday, the 21st August, at 4 o&#8217;clock in the
morning, the soldiers spread themselves through the Town, driving all
the population into the streets and forcing men, women and children to
march before them with their hands in the air. Those who did not obey
with sufficient promptitude, or did not understand the order given them
in German, were promptly knocked down. Those who tried to run away were
shot. It was at this moment that Dr. Camus, against whom the Germans
seemed to have some special spite, was wounded by a rifle shot, and
then finished off by a blow from an axe. His body was dragged along
by the feet for some distance. A watchmaker, a Fleming by birth, who
had lived for some time in the Town, was coming out of his house on
the order of the soldiers, supporting on his arm his father-in-law,
an old man of 80. Naturally, therefore, he could not hold up both his
hands. A soldier stepped up to him and struck him with an axe on the
neck. He fell mortally wounded before his own door. His wife tried to
bring him assistance, was pushed back into the house, and had to assist
helplessly at the last agony of her husband. A soldier threatened to
shoot her with his revolver if she crossed the door-sill.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the whole population was being driven towards the Place
des Tilleuls. Old men, the sick and the paralysed were all brought
there. Some were drawn on wheel-chairs, others pushed on hand carts,
others, again, borne up by their relations. The men were separated
from the women and children, then all were searched, but no arms were
found on them. One man had in his pocket some empty cartridge cases
both German and Belgian. He was immediately apprehended and set aside.
So was a cobbler who had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"
id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> wounded hand; the wound was a month old.
An engineer was also put apart because he had in his pocket a spanner,
which was considered as a weapon. Another man seems to have been
arrested because his face showed his contempt and rage at what was
going on. These people were shot in presence of the crowd and all died
bravely.</p>

<p>Subsequently the soldiers, on the order of their officers, picked
out of the mass some 40 or 50 men who were led off and all shot,
some along the bank of the Meuse, and others in front of the Police
Station.</p>

<p>The rest of the men were kept for a long time in the Place. Among
them lay two persons, one of whom had received a ball in the chest,
and the other a bayonet wound. They lay face to the ground with blood
from their wounds trickling into the dust, occasionally calling for
water. The officers forbade their neighbours to give them any help.
One soldier was reproved for having wished to give one of them his
water-bottle. Both died in the course of the day.</p>

<p>While this scene was going on in the Place des Tilleuls, other
soldiers spread themselves through the Town, continuing their work of
sack, pillage and arson. Eight men belonging to the same household were
led out into a meadow some 50 yards from their dwelling, some of them
were shot, the rest cut down with blows of an axe. One tall red-haired
soldier with a scar on his face distinguished himself by the ferocity
with which he used an axe. A young boy and a woman were shot.</p>

<p>About 10 in the morning the officers told the women to withdraw,
giving them the order to gather together the dead bodies and to wash
away the stains of blood which defiled the street and the houses. About
midday the surviving men to the number of 800 were shut up as hostages
in three little houses near the bridge, but they were not allowed to
go out of them on any pretext, and so crammed together that they could
not even sit down on the floor. Soon these crowded buildings reached a
highly insanitary condition. The women later in the day were allowed
to bring food to their husbands. Many of them, fearing outrage, had
fled from the Place. These hostages were not finally released till the
Tuesday following.</p>

<p>The statistics of the losses at Andenne give the following
total:&mdash;Three hundred were massacred in Andenne and Seilles, and
about 300 houses were burnt in the two localities. A great number of
inhabitants have fled. Almost every house has been sacked; indeed,
the pillage did not end for eight days. Other places have suffered
more than Andenne, but no other Belgian Town was the theatre of so
many scenes of ferocity and cruelty. The numerous inhabitants whom we
have cross-examined are unanimous in asserting that the German troops
were not fired upon. They told us that no<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> German soldier was killed
either at Andenne or in its neighbourhood. They are incapable of
understanding the causes of the catastrophe which has ruined their
town, and to explain it they give various hypotheses. Some think that
Andenne was sacrificed merely to establish a reign of terror, and
quote words uttered by officers which seemed to them to show that
the destruction of the place was premeditated. Others think that the
destruction of the bridge, the ruining of a neighbouring tunnel, and
the resistance of the Belgian troops were the causes of the massacre.
All protest that nothing happened in the place to excuse the conduct of
the Germans.</p>

<h3>(IV.) SACK OF DINANT.</h3>

<p>The town of Dinant was sacked and destroyed by the German Army,
and its population was decimated on the 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th
August.</p>

<p>On August 15th a lively engagement took place at Dinant between
the French troops on the left bank of the Meuse and the German troops
coming up from the East. The German troops were routed by the French,
who passed over to the right bank of the river following them. The
town had little to suffer on that day. Some houses were destroyed by
German shells, aimed no doubt at French regiments on the left bank, and
a citizen of Dinant belonging to the Red Cross was killed by a German
ball as he was picking up a wounded man.</p>

<p>The days which followed were calm. The French occupied the
neighborhood of the town. No engagement took place between the hostile
armies, and nothing happened which could be interpreted as an act
of hostility by the population. No German troops were anywhere near
Dinant. On Friday, the 21st, about 9 o&#8217;clock in the evening,
German troops coming down the road from Ciney entered the town by the
Rue St. Jacques. On entering they began firing into the windows of
the houses, and killed a workman who was returning to his own house,
wounded another inhabitant, and forced him to cry &#8220;Long live
the Kaiser.&#8221; They bayoneted a third person in the stomach. They
entered the cafes, seized the liquor, got drunk, and retired after
having set fire to several houses and broken the doors and windows of
others. The population was terrorised and stupefied, and shut itself up
in its dwellings.</p>

<p>Saturday, August 22nd, was a day of relative calm. All life,
however, was at an end in the streets. Part of the inhabitants, guided
by the instincts of self-preservation, fled into the neighbouring
country side. The rest, more attached to their homes, and rendered
confident by the conviction that nothing had happened which could be
interpreted as an act of hostility on their part, remained hidden in
their houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14"
id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday morning next, the 23rd, at 6.30 in the morning,
soldiers of the 108th Regiment of Infantry invaded the Church of the
Premonastrensian Fathers, drove out the congregation, separated the
women from the men, and shot 50 of the latter. Between 7 and 9 the same
morning the soldiers gave themselves up to pillage and arson, going
from house to house and driving the inhabitants into the street. Those
who tried to escape were shot. About 9 in the morning the soldiery,
driving before them by blows from the butt ends of rifles men, women,
and children, pushed them all into the Parade Square, where they were
kept prisoners till 6 o&#8217;clock in the evening. The guard took
pleasure in repeating to them that they would soon be shot. About 6
o&#8217;clock a Captain separated the men from the women and children.
The women were placed in front of a rank of infantry soldiers, the men
were ranged along a wall. The front rank of them were then told to
kneel, the others standing behind them. A platoon of soldiers drew up
in face of these unhappy men. It was in vain that the women cried out
for mercy for their husbands, sons, and brothers. The officer ordered
his men to fire. There had been no inquiry nor any pretense of a trial.
About 20 of the inhabitants were only wounded, but fell among the dead.
The soldiers, to make sure, fired a new volley into the heap of them.
Several citizens escaped this double discharge. They shammed dead for
more than two hours, remaining motionless among the corpses, and when
night fell succeeded in saving themselves in the hills. Eighty-four
corpses were left on the Square, and buried in a neighbouring
garden.</p>

<p>The day of August 23rd was made bloody by several more massacres.
Soldiers discovered some inhabitants of the Faubourg St. Pierre in the
cellars of a brewery there and shot them.</p>

<p>Since the previous evening a crowd of workmen belonging to the
factory of M. Himmer had hidden themselves, along with their wives and
children, in the cellars of the building. They had been joined there by
many neighbours and several members of the family of their employer.
About 6 o&#8217;clock in the evening these unhappy people made up their
minds to come out of their refuge, and defiled all trembling from the
cellars with the white flag in front. They were immediately seized and
violently attacked by the soldiers. Every man was shot on the spot.
Almost all the men of the Faubourg de Leffe were executed <i lang="fr"
xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>. In another part of the town 12 civilians were
killed in a cellar. In the Rue en Ile a paralytic was shot in his
armchair. In the Rue Enfer the soldiers killed a young boy of 14.</p>

<p>In the Faubourg de Leffe the viaduct of the railway was the scene
of a bloody massacre. An old woman and all her children were killed in
their cellar. A man of 65 years, his wife, his son and his daughter
were shot against a wall. Other inhabitants of Leffe were taken in a
barge as far as the rock of Bayard and shot there, among them a woman
of 83 and her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15"
id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain number of men and women had been locked up in the Court
of the Prison. At six in the evening a German machine gun, placed on
the hill above, opened fire on them, and an old woman and three other
persons were brought down.</p>

<p>While a certain number of soldiers were perpetrating this massacre,
others pillaged and sacked the houses of the town, and broke open all
safes, sometimes blasting them with dynamite. Their work of destruction
and theft accomplished, the soldiers set fire to the houses, and the
town was soon no more than an immense furnace.</p>

<p>The women and children had been all shut up in a Convent, where
they were kept prisoners for four days. These unhappy women remained
in ignorance of the lot of their male relations. They were expecting
themselves to be shot also. All around the town continued to blaze. The
first day the monks of the Convent had given them a certain supply of
food. For the remaining days they had nothing to eat but raw carrots
and green fruit.</p>

<p>To sum up, the town of Dinant is destroyed. It counted 1,400 houses;
only 200 remain. The manufactories where the artisan population worked
have been systematically destroyed. Rather more than 700 of the
inhabitants have been killed; others have been taken off to Germany,
and are still retained there as prisoners. The majority are refugees
scattered all through Belgium. A few who remained in the town are dying
of hunger. It has been proved by our Enquiry that German soldiers,
while exposed to the fire of the French entrenched on the opposite bank
of the Meuse, in certain cases sheltered themselves behind a line of
civilians, women and children.</p>

<h3>(V.) MASSACRES AT HASTIERE AND SURICE</h3>

<p>On August 23rd, the Germans entered the village of
Hastiere-par-dela.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> They arrested Dr. Halloy,
a Surgeon of the Red Cross, and shot him. Crossing the street, they
went to the house of Alphonse Aigret, a butcher, drove out him, his
wife and his children, and shot him and his elder son. Next they went
to the farm of Jules Rifon, took him out of his cellar, where he had
hidden with his daughters, and shot him. They also killed the farmer
Bodson and his two sons, with ten other inhabitants of the village.
The place was then sacked, and the greater part of the houses burned.
The number of persons killed or wounded was very large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The ancient church of Hastiere suffered odious profanation. Horses
were stabled in it. The priestly vestments were torn and befouled. The
lamps, statues, and holy-water stoups were broken. The reliquary was
smashed, and the relics scattered about. Among them were some relics
of the Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne, which had escaped the fury
of the Huguenots of 1590 and the Revolution of 1790. The tabernacle
resisted an attempt at burglary, but two of the four altars were
profaned; the sepulchres at the altars were broken open and the remains
in them thrown out and trampled under foot.</p>

<p>The parish priest of Hastiere, Abbe Emile Schogel, had taken refuge
in the crypt, with his brother-in-law, M. Ponthiere, a professor of the
University of Louvain, the wife and two daughters of the professor, two
servants, the schoolmaster of the village with his wife and family, and
other inhabitants. The Germans fired at them through the windows of the
crypt, and then forced them to come up to the road, where they were
brought before several officers, of whom some were intoxicated. Some
questions were put to the Abbe, but he was given no time to answer.
The women were then dragged apart from the men, and the priest, M.
Pointhiere, the schoolmaster, and the other men were shot; their bodies
were left lying on the road. All this happened on August 24th, 1914, at
about 5.30 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>On this same day the village of Surice was occupied by the German
troops. At about 11 p. m. they set fire to some of the houses. Next
morning, about 6 o&#8217;clock, the soldiers broke open doors and
windows with the butts of their rifles, and forced all the inhabitants
to come out. They were led off in the direction of the church. On the
way several most inoffensive people were fired upon. For example, the
old choirman, Charles Colot, aged 88, was shot as he came out of his
door; the soldiers rolled his body in a blanket, and set fire to it.</p>

<p>A man named Elie Pierrot was seized by the Germans as he was coming
out of his burning house, carrying his aged and impotent step-mother
(she was over 80 years of age), and was shot at short range. The clerk,
Leopold Burniaux, his son Armand, who had been recently ordained
priest, and another of his sons were shot before the eyes of Madame
Burniaux. She, with her last surviving son, a professor at the College
of Malonne, were marched off with the surviving inhabitants on the road
to Romedenne. In a garden below the road there was a dead woman lying,
with two small children crying over her.</p>

<p>On arriving at Fosses the party were led to a piece of fallow
ground&mdash;they numbered between 50 and 60 persons of both
sexes. &#8220;It was about 7.15 a. m. when the men and the
women were separated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"
id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> An officer came up who said to us in
French with a strong German accent, &#8216;You all deserve to be shot:
a young girl of 15 has just fired on one of our Commanders. But the
Court-martial has decided that only the men shall be executed: the
women will be kept prisoners.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The scene that followed passes all description: there were
eighteen men standing in a row: besides the parish priests of Anthee
and Onhaye, and the Abbe Gaspiard, there was our own priest, Mons.
Poskin, and his brother-in-law, Mons. Schmidt, then Doctor Jacques and
his son Henri, aged just 16, then Gaston Burniaux, the clerk&#8217;s
son, and Leonard Soumoy: next them two men named Balbeur and Billy,
with the 17-year-old son of the latter: last two men from Onhaye and
Dinant who had taken refuge in Surice, and two people more whom I did
not know. Mons. Schmidt&#8217;s little boy of 14 was nearly put into
the line&mdash;the soldiers hesitated, but finally shoved him away in a
brutal fashion. At this moment I saw a young German soldier&mdash;this
I vouch for&mdash;who was so horror-struck that great tears were
dropping onto his tunic: he did not wipe his eyes for fear of being
seen by his officer, but kept his head turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some minutes passed: then under our eyes and amid the
shrieks of women who were crying &#8216;Shoot me too; shoot me with my
husband!&#8217; and the wailing of the children, the men were lined
up on the edge of the hollow way which runs from the high road to the
bottom of the village. They waved last greetings to us, some with their
hands, others with their hats or caps. The young Henri Jacques was
leaning on the shoulder of one of the priests, as if to seek help and
courage from him: he was sobbing, &#8216;I am too young; I can&#8217;t
face death bravely.&#8217; Unable to bear the sight any longer, I
turned my back to the road and covered my eyes with my hands. The
soldiers fired their volley, and the men fell in a heap. Someone said
to me, &#8216;Look, they are all down!&#8217; But they were not all
shot dead; several were finished off by having their skulls beaten in
with rifle-butts. Among these was the priest of Surice, whose head (as
I was afterwards told) was dreadfully opened out.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the massacre was over the Germans plundered the corpses.
They took from them watches, rings, purses, and pocket-books. Madame
Schmidt told me that her husband had on him about 3,000 francs, which
was stolen. Dr. Jacques had also a good sum on him, though his wife
could not say exactly how much.</p>

<p>&#8220;After this some more German soldiers brought up a
man named Victor Cavillot, and shot him before he reached
the spot where the others were lying; they fired on him, and
I saw him double up and fall into the hollow way.&#8221;<a
name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
class="fnanchor">(2)</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The village of Surice was thoroughly sacked. The pillage began on
Tuesday night, and continued all day on Wednesday. The safe of Madame
Laurent-Mineur, a widow, was blown open with dynamite. Of the 131
houses of the village only eight escaped the conflagration.</p>

<p>This Report gives no more than an incomplete picture of the German
ravages and crimes in the Province of Namur. We lack detailed knowledge
of what went on in three of the six cantons which form the district
of Namur. The total of 800 persons killed and 1,160 houses burned in
that district may have to be largely increased. In the district of
Dinant, that town itself and 21 villages have been destroyed. In the
district of Philippeville 20 villages have been sacked, plundered, and
more or less burned down. In the whole province, which has 364,000
inhabitants, nearly 2,000 unoffending people&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;have been massacred.</p>

<hr class="r20" />

<p>The Commission makes it a rule to limit its publications to a mere
statement of facts, thinking that no commentary could add anything to
their tragic eloquence. It thinks, however, that the evidence given
above leads to certain conclusions.</p>

<p>It has been said that when Belgium makes up the account of her
losses, it may appear that war has levied more victims from the civil
population than from the men who were called out to serve their country
on the battlefield. This prophecy, which seemed contrary to reason, is
now confirmed as regards the Province of Namur. In certain parts of
it half the male adult population has disappeared: the horrors of the
conflagrations at Louvain and Termonde, of the massacres at Aerschot
and in Luxembourg and Brabant, are all surpassed by those of the
slaughter at Dinant, at Andenne, at Tamines, and at Namur.</p>

<p>In this twentieth century the people of Namur have had to live
through all the frightful details of a mediæval war, with its
traditional episodes of massacres <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>,
drunken orgies, sack of whole towns, and general conflagration. The
&#8220;exploits&#8221; of the mercenary bands of the XVIIth Century
have been surpassed by those of the national army of a State which
claims the first place among civilized nations!</p>

<p>The German Government cannot deny the truth of these
facts&mdash;they are attested by the ruins and the graves which cover
our native soil. But already it has set to work to excuse its troops,
affirming that they only repressed, in consonance with the Laws of War,
the hostile acts of the Belgian civil population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>From the day of its First Session our Commission has been trying
to discover what foundation there might be for this charge&mdash;a
charge which seemed very unconvincing to anyone who knew the
character of the Belgian people. After having examined hundreds
of witnesses&mdash;foreigners and natives&mdash;and after having
exhausted every possible means of investigation, we affirm once more
that the Belgian people took no part in the hostilities. The supposed
&#8220;France-Tireur&#8221; War, which is said to have been waged
against the German Army, is a mere invention. It was invented in order
to lessen in the eyes of the civilized world the impression caused by
the barbarous treatment inflicted by the German Army on our people,
and also to appease the scruples of the German nation, which will
shudder with fear on the day when it learns what a tribute of innocent
blood was levied by its troops on our children, our wives, and our
defenseless fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Moreover, the chiefs of the German Army have made a singular error
when they try to influence the verdict of the civilized world by this
particular argument. They seem unaware of the fact that the repression
by general measures of individual faults&mdash;a system condemned by
the International Conventions at which they scoff&mdash;has long been
condemned by the conscience of the nations of to-day. Among those
nations Germany appears for the future as a monstrous and disconcerting
moral phenomenon.</p>

<h2>THE GERMAN MILITARY CODE</h2>

<p>In 1902 the Historic Section of the German General Staff published a
collection of works for the instruction and guidance of the officers of
the German Army. Among these works is a Manual upon &#8220;The Laws of
War on Land.&#8221; (&#8220;Kriegsgebrauch im Landkriege.&#8221;) The
following extracts from this manual show that the ideas of the German
General Staff on the conduct of warfare are diametrically opposed
to the views generally adopted by civilized countries. It is the
systematic carrying-out of these ideas which has caused the devastation
and desolation of Belgium.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is by making a deep study of the history of wars
that, &#8220;<em>one may protect oneself against exaggerated
humanitarian ideas</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right mr2">(Laws of War on Land, pp. 6 and 7)</p>

<p>The claims of professors of International Law (in regard to a
certain point under discussion) &#8220;should be deliberately rejected
in principle as being opposed to the rules of war.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right mr2">(Ibid page 46)</p>

<p>The claims of certain professors of International Law in this
respect are absolutely contrary to the necessities of warfare,
&#8220;and should be rejected by military men.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right mr2">(Ibid pages 44 and 45)</p>

<p>An energetically conducted war cannot be carried on solely against
the combatant enemy and his defenses, but extends and should extend
to <em>the destruction of his material and moral resources. Humanitarian
considerations, such as respect for persons and property, can be taken
into consideration only provided that the nature and object of the war
adapt themselves to that course.</em></p>

<p class="right mr2">(Ibid page 3)</p></div>

<p>The above extracts indicate clearly the spirit of the German
military class, namely,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To protect themselves against humanitarian ideas, as against a
dangerous infection.</p>

<p>To cast aside international law if found incompatible with
convenience.</p>

<p>To strike not only at the enemy&#8217;s armed forces, but
to terrorise him by striking at his &#8220;material and
moral resources,&#8221; <i>i. e.</i> his home and property, his
wife and children.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>These injunctions of the German Code of 1902 have been fully carried
out in Belgium, and have converted the German army into &#8220;a horde
of barbarians and a band of incendiaries.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;ethics&#8221; of the German Military Code have also
been supported by German jurists inoculated with the germ of the same
&#8220;Kultur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meurer, in his book on the Hague Peace Conference, says that
there is no violation of international law &#8220;when an act of
war is necessary to support the troops or to defend them against a
danger which cannot be avoided by any other means, or when the act
is necessary in order to realize or assure the success of a military
operation which is not in itself prohibited.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right mr2">(&#8220;Die Haager Friedenskonferenz,&#8221; II
Band, page 14)</p>

<p>In other words &#8220;Necessity Knows No Law.&#8221; It is the
same doctrine proclaimed by the Imperial German Chancellor, Dr. von
Bethmann-Hollweg, and upheld by other German jurists such as Dr. Karl
Strupp, who says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;A body of troops may be obliged to let their prisoners
starve, if the commander thinks this is the only means of carrying out
an order which he has received, for example, an order to reach, at
a certain time, a place indispensable for the proper conduct of the
operations.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stipulations of the Laws of War may be disregarded
whenever the violation of them seems to be the only means of
carrying out a military operation or of assuring its success, or,
indeed, of supporting the armed forces, even though it be only one
soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>In short, according to the German idea, the recognized Laws of War,
as understood by civilized nations, are to be practised by Germany
only when found convenient. The alleged killing of one German soldier
in Aerschot led to the destruction of the whole town and the massacre
of many innocent citizens. It was contrary to Law, but it was in
accordance with the spirit of the German Military Code of 1902.</p>

<p>The German Army invaded Belgium with the full intention, in case
of resistance, of carrying on a war of terror by means of massacre,
robbery and destruction&mdash;a war to &#8220;destroy the material and
moral resources of the enemy.&#8221; Moreover, the German officers were
provided with forms drawn up in the French language to facilitate them,
especially in their work of robbery and arson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22"
id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>They do not seem to have needed anything to facilitate them in their
work of massacre.</p>

<p>These forms are found in a book published at Berlin by Bath, in
1906, entitled &#8220;The Military Interpreter,&#8221; destined for
the use of German officers &#8220;in the enemy&#8217;s country,&#8221;
which seems to be a French speaking country such as Belgium or France,
as the forms are drawn up in French. The book contains, to quote its
introduction, &#8220;the French text of the majority of the documents,
letters, proclamations and other forms which may be needed in time of
war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among these interesting documents we find the following form to be
used by officers when wishing to rob a whole city at once. It will be
observed that the pretended excuse for the robbery is supplied. The
document is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;A fine of 600,000 marks, on account of the attempted
assassination of a German soldier by a .........., has been imposed
upon the City of O......... by order of...........</p>

<p>&#8220;Fruitless efforts have been made to secure the remittance or
reduction of this fine.</p>

<p>&#8220;The limit of time fixed for the payment of the fine expires
tomorrow, Saturday, December 17th, at noon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bank Notes, Coin, or Silverware will be
accepted.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The general outline of this useful form was followed by General
Baron von Leutwitz when on November 1st, 1914, he imposed upon the City
of Brussels &#8220;an additional fine of Five Million Francs&#8221; on
account of an alleged altercation between a Belgian policeman, named De
Ryckere, and a German soldier.</p>

<p>Here is another form, intended to give an air of justification to an
act of robbery:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The German authorities, having demanded a war contribution
of two million francs from the city of M........., because its
inhabitants fired upon the German troops when entering the city, and
the municipality having declared that it has not the necessary funds
and that it cannot find such funds among the citizens, the German
authorities demand a settlement by bills of exchange.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>If the above demand failed to produce the desired results, the
German Commanders were provided with another form to be used<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> as a
&#8220;follow-up&#8221; letter. This is a form of letter to be written
by the Commanding General to his subordinate, and the substance is to
be communicated to the recalcitrant citizens.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th of this
month telling me of the great difficulties you think you will meet in
collecting the contributions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only regret the explanations that you think proper
to make on this subject. The order in question (which comes from my
Government) is so clear and precise, the orders which I have received
(on this subject) are so explicit, that, <em>if the amount due by the
City of B......... is not paid the city will be burned without
mercy</em>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The foregoing form seems to have been substantially followed by
Lieutenant General von Niebur in his letter to the Burgomaster of Wavre
on August 27th, 1914. A fine of three million francs was imposed upon
the little town of Wavre for an alleged attack on the German troops,
and in his letter of the above date Lieutenant General von Niebur
declares that &#8220;<em>the City of Wavre will be burned and destroyed
if the levy is not paid in due time, without regard for anyone; the
innocent will suffer with the guilty</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here is another form for extorting money from a community:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;On account of the destruction of the bridge at F......... I
command, as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;The district shall pay an additional contribution of ten
million francs, as a fine. This information is brought to the knowledge
of the public with the following notice, namely, that the manner of
distributing the assessment will be indicated later, and that the
payment of the said amount will be exacted with the greatest severity.
<em>The village of F......... has been at once burned with the exception
of certain houses reserved for the use of the troops.</em>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="hang">
<p>The foregoing form recalls the Proclamation of General
von Buelow to the Municipal Authorities of Liege, on August 22nd, 1914,
in which he said:</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<em>It is with my consent that the Commander-in-Chief
has ordered the whole town (of Andenne) to be
burned and that about one hundred people have been
shot.</em>&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The scenes of horror and barbarism depicted in the Reports of
the Official Belgian Commission of Inquiry have not been brought
about by accident. They are the direct result of the orders given
and the doctrines inculcated by the German General Staff.</p>

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
